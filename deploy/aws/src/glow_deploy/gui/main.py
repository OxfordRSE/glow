"""PyInstaller entry point: start the local server and open a browser tab.

A frozen build has no visible console — this is also how the app is run from
source for local dev/manual smoke-testing (`uv run glow-deploy-gui`).

There's no native window here, just a browser tab pointed at a local server,
so two lifecycle gaps need covering by hand:

- Relaunching while an instance is already running used to just exit
  silently (the single-instance lock refused the bind, the print went
  nowhere in a frozen build). Now the running instance's port is read back
  out of a state file and the browser is reopened at it instead.
- Closing the browser tab left the server running forever with no UI to
  bring it back. A heartbeat pinged from every page (see heartbeat.ts) lets
  a watcher thread notice the tab is gone and quit — but never while a
  provision/update job is still running (see jobs.JobManager), since that's
  a `terraform apply` a hard kill would leave state-locked.
