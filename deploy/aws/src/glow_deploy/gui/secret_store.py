"""OS-keychain-backed storage for AWS credentials, with a graceful in-memory fallback.

Real risk area: headless/minimal Linux desktops without a Secret Service
provider (no gnome-keyring/kwallet) can't back `keyring` at all. Rather than
building custom encryption for that case, we degrade to storing credentials
in-memory only for the lifetime of the process, with a clear one-time warning
so the caller (GUI) can surface it via `backend_name()`.
